## ABOUT THE PROJECT
1.  Added 4 products as mentioned namely- 
    a) Flamingo Cake
    b) Candy Cake
    c) Butter Cream Cake
    d) Beach Cup Cake
  
2.  Created "add to cart" feature enabling end user to modify the quantity on the go. The "add to cart" button disappears when the quantity is more than 0 and reappears when the quantity is reduced to 0.
3.  On click of "checkout" button in the navigation bar, it prints the cost of each item and the cummulative cost of the overall bill in the console.
4.  For navigation I have added various hyperlinks in the navigation bar at the top of the webpage.
5.  The webpage is responsive therefore independent of the size of the screen it is being represented on.
